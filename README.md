– Verified the amplifier’s DC operating points, ensuring proper biasing with a quiescent current of 2 mA and a DC
gain of 45 dB at a supply voltage of 1.8 V.
– Measured a differential-mode gain of 40 dB and a phase margin of 65°, with a -3 dB bandwidth of 10 MHz,
ensuring stable operation.
– Evaluated the transient response, achieving a slew rate of 5 V/μs, and assessed noise performance, with an input
referred noise of 10 nV/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz.
